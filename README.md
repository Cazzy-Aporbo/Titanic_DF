## Titanic Dataset Analysis and Feature Engineering

### Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset and performing feature engineering to prepare the data for machine learning models. The main goal is to understand the dataset, create relevant features, and handle missing values.

### Dataset

The dataset used is the famous Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including whether they survived or not. The dataset includes the following features:

- PassengerId
- Survived
- Pclass
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp
- Parch
- Ticket
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked

### Requirements

To run this project, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scipy

You can install the required packages using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy
```

### Feature Engineering Steps

1. **Cabin Feature**:
   - Fill NaN values in the 'Cabin' column with 'O'
   - Create a new 'Cabin_type' column based on the first character of the 'Cabin' value

2. **Name Feature**:
   - Extract titles from the 'Name' column to create a new 'Title' feature

3. **Age Feature**:
   - Fill NaN values in the 'Age' column with the mean age for each title group

4. **Embarked Feature**:
   - Drop the two records with missing 'Embarked' values

### Visualizations

The project includes several visualizations to help understand the data:

1. Survival count based on Sex
2. Distribution of Ages (overall and by gender)
3. Survival count based on Passenger Class
4. Survival count based on Port of Embarkation
5. Survival count based on Embarked and Sex
6. Survival count based on Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard
7. Survival count based on Number of Parents/Children Aboard
8. Survival count based on Title (separate plots for males and females)

### Key Observations

- Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males
- First-class passengers had a higher survival rate compared to second and third-class passengers
- Passengers who embarked from Cherbourg (C) had a higher survival rate
- Passengers with 1 or 2 family members aboard had a higher survival rate
- The 'Title' feature provides insights into survival rates, with variations among different titles for both males and females

### Future Work

This project focuses on feature engineering and data exploration. Future steps could include:

1. Building and comparing different machine learning models for survival prediction
2. Further feature engineering, such as creating family size features or ticket-based features
3. Performing feature selection to identify the most important predictors of survival
4. Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for model optimization
